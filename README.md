# *simpleSankey*

This is a fork from [gaborcsardi/sankey](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/sankey) with some simple modifications. To avoid confussion with package *sankey* I'm re-naming this package *simpleSankey* as this package removes central funcitonality from *sankey* (namely color gradients) while permitting new incompatible features (namely transparent colors).

More changes are likely forthcoming.
